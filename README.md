## **1. Introduction**
The proposed game serves as a demonstration for the subject Object Technologies, with the aim of creating a functional prototype of the game as a project for the exam. The created game meets the requirements of the assigned topic. 
The game is a an action-rouglike bullet hell topdown shooter, where the player has to navigate between enemies, and kill everyone in said time period.

### **1.1 Inspiration**
<ins>**Vampire survivors**</ins>

Vampire survivors is a top down bullet hell shooter, with minimal animatio, level design and storytelling but with more functionality, and logic. In the game you need to collect not only your weapons but items also to make you stronger.
The premise of the game is to get the right weapons with the right items to be able to evolve them, so you get through the levels easier. You evolve weapons by killing enemies, which drops xp. You can also collect
coins through your run which is used to buy permanent upgrades, and to unlock characters.

## **2. Concept**

### **2.1 Gameplay Overview**
The player is being attacked by different kind of enemies spawning on the edge of the map and getting closer to the player. However the player is not helpless he has special weapons to use against the attacking monsters.

### **2.2 Theme Interpretation**
**"Bullet hell"** - The player is always chased by the enemies, and the enemies always know where the player is. The player has to have good reflexes to pathfind in such manner that he dodges the enemies and their respective projectiles too.

### **2.3 Primary Mechanics**
- **Obstacles**: There are objects on the map that create an active obstacle for the player, but not for the enemy. The player has to watch out for this.
- **Bonus item**: The player can collect healthpacks which heals the wounded player.
- **Enemy spawning**: Enemies are randomly spawning in all the directions of the map at the edge of the screen.
- **Gun**: The player has a "gun" but not any kind, its his elemental powers. He can switch between them using the number keys, and each one has their own gimmick to play with.
